            <h3>After Inlays/Onlays</h3>
            <p>
                Inlays and Onlays usually take two appointments. At the first appointment the teeth are prepared. A rubber type temporary
                is then placed in the preparation to protect the tooth where the custom made permanent restoration is fabricated.
                After each appointment when anesthetic has been used, your lips, teeth and tongue may be numb for several
                hours after the appointment. Avoid any chewing until the numbness has completely worn off.
            </p>
            <p>
                On rare occasions temporary Inlays/Onlays come off. The temporary is like a piece of a rubber puzzle. You can try to put
                it back into place. If you cannot or do not want to try, call us at (847) 329-9801 so you can schedule a
                time to come to the office so we can put it into place.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's normal to experience some hot, cold and pressure sensitivity after each appointment. Your gums may be sore for several
                days. Rinse three times a day with warm salt water (a tsp. of salt in a cup of warm water, rinse-swish-spit)
                to reduce pain and swelling. Use medication only as directed.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help keep your temporary in place, avoid eating sticky foods (especially gum), hard foods, and if possible, chew only
                on the opposite side of your mouth. It's important to continue to brush normally and even spend a little
                extra time around your temporary.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your bite feels uneven, if you have persistent pain, or if you have any other questions or concerns, please call our office
                at (847) 329-9801.

            <h3>After Crown and Bridge Appointments</h3>
            <p>
                Crowns and bridges usually take two or three appointments to complete. On the first appointment the teeth are prepared. Temporary
                crowns or bridges are placed to protect the teeth while the custom restoration is being made. After each
                appointment when anesthetic has been used, your lips, teeth and tongue may be numb for several hours after
                the appointment. Avoid chewing until the numbness has completely worn off.
            </p>
            <p>
                On rare occasions, temporary crowns come off. Call us if this happens and keep the temporary so we can re-cement it. It is
                very important for the proper fit of your final restoration that temporaries stay in place.

            <h3>Post-Surgery Instructions</h3>
            <p>
                Following periodontal surgery, you can expect a number of normal events during the healing process. Do not participate in
                any strenuous activity, get plenty of rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Get all prescribed medications and take as instructed immediately following surgical appointment. If you develop any rashes
                or hives after taking any medications, you may be experiencing an allergic reaction-discontinue medications
                and call the office or Dr. Vest's pager.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Discomfort:</strong> Take the prescribed medication(s) ASAP following your surgical appointment. This will
                keep you comfortable and allow a smooth transition once the local anesthetic wears off.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Bleeding:</strong> You may experience slight oozing of blood in your saliva the next 24-36 hours. If there
                is any significant bleeding, fold a piece of gauze and apply gentle pressure for 20-30 minutes. A tea bag
                can also be used in a similar matter after it is moistened with warm water.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Swelling:</strong> To keep any potential swelling to a minimum, apply an ice pack (bag of frozen vegetablesâ€¦etc.)
                to the outer cheek or jaw for 10 minute (on/off) intervals for the next 3-4 hours. Slight swelling may be
                expected during the first few days, and begin to decrease after the 4th day. If swelling continues to worsen
                call the office or doctor's pager immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Diet:</strong> Avoid eating on the side which surgery has been performed. Eat soft foods and drink of cold
                liquids. Avoid hot liquids for 3-4 days, or allow them to cool prior to drinking. Avoid spicy foods and acidic
                liquids (ex. Orange juice, tomato juice).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Oral Hygiene:</strong> Avoid brushing the area of surgery, but do brush and floss all other areas as you
                normally would. You may resume light brushing after one week.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Mouth Rinse:</strong> Unless a medicated mouth rinse has been prescribed. Rinse lightly with warm salt water
                (1/2 teaspoon of salt in Â½ cup warm water) 2-3 times daily for 30-60 seconds. Then rinse with clear water
                to rinse out remaining salt.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Smoking:</strong> Smoking should be avoided throughout the entire healing phase to obtain optimum results.
                Absolutely no smoking should occur the first 24 hours following surgery.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Women:</strong> If you are currently taking birth control pills, please be aware that taking any antibiotics
                concurrently, could decrease the efficacy of the birth control pill. Another method of birth control should
                be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you experience difficulties other than what is listed above, please do not hesitate to call the office or page Dr. Vest's
                pager

            <h3>After Extractions/Oral Surgery</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Swelling:</strong> Following some surgical procedures, it is normal to exhibit swelling, discoloration and
                limited opening of the mouth. Apply ice compresses on the face overlaying the area of surgery for the first
                24 hours. Keep the ice compress on one half hour, then 10 minutes off, alternating each side. After the first
                24 hours, warm, moist compresses may be applied in the same manner to help hasten the healing process and
                limit facial swelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Protection of Blood Clots:</strong> Maintain gentle pressure by biting on gauge sponges that have been placed
                over the surgical area for at least 1 hour. Replace gauze as necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Do Not Rinse:</strong> Avoid the use of a mouth wash. After 24 hours, rinse with warm water every 3 or 4
                hours. (The use of commercial mouth washes during the healing period is not recommended.)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Pain:</strong> Following surgery, it is normal to experience some pain and discomfort. If medication has
                been given or prescribed, take as instructed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Eating:</strong> Adequate food and fluid intake following surgery is most important. A liquid or soft diet,
                such as, Sego or Carnation Instant Breakfast are recommended for the first 4 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Avoid:</strong> All excessive activity, do not pick at the surgical area, do not consume liquids through
                a straw and avoid alcoholic beverages until you are no longer taking medication.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>DO NOT:</strong> Smoke or drink alcoholic beverages 24 hours after extractions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event that pain or swelling persists 24 hours and does not begin to decrease, please call Dr. Davidson at

            <h3>Instructions for Tooth Bleaching Gel</h3>
            <p>
                Congratulations! You have made an excellent decision to improve your smile.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read the following information and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Also, remember to tell
                your friends about the wonderful results you will achieve. Brush and floss your teeth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Twist the top of the seal syringe to align the tip with the black O-ring. Extrude a small amount of Life-Like gel into each
                tooth space of your mouth tray. The calibrations on the side are designed to prevent your from overfilling
                the mouth tray. You need just Â½ cc of material to fill the entire tray. Wear the tray in your mouth. Using
                1/2cc leaves no significant excess material.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wear the tray while you sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you wake up brush your teeth as normal, rinse and brush out your tray to remove excess material that may be present
                after each treatment. Do not use hot water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat this procedure for 7-12 days. Monitor your results until you have achieved the desired whiteness. Keep bleaching gel
                out of direct light.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Suggestions:</h4>
                <p>
                    Refrain from eating, drinking or smoking for 30 minutes after wearing the whitening gel. Also avoid citrus foods and beverages
                    to minimize discomfort from sensitivity for approximately 30 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't be alarmed if your teeth become sensitive. It is a temporary side effect some people have. The sensitivity will go
                    away completely 1-2 days after the bleaching has stopped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To maintain whiteness, repeat the treatment procedure for two days every four to six months, or as prescribed.
                </p>
